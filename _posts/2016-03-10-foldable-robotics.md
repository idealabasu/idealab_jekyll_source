Professor Aukes will be teaching a new EGR598 class this fall called *Foldable Robotics*. 

Description
-----------
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">
<p>Foldable Robotics is a class which comes from a new class of active robotic devices being developed in research labs across the country.  These devices are designed and built using flat sheets of a wide variety of materials, and folded up to create both form and motion.  This class studies these devices from initial prototype and design through implementation and optimization, with a focus on application-specific projects which seek to solve problems of cost, parallelism, complexity, and time with a relatively fast and easy prototyping method.  This class allows students to delve deeper into the analytical problems associated with these devices, in topics such as Design, Manufacturing, Dynamics & Simulation, Optimization, Kinematics & Motion, and Finite Element Analysis.

Prerequisites
-------------

There are no formal prerequisites, but students should have a familiarity with programming.  We will be programming in Python, which is easy to learn especially if you have programmed in something else.
