Design Tools
============

We are developing a suite of design tools intended to work together to give a picture of how a designed robot will perform, as well as interact with the world.

    <p> We have developed [popupCAD](http://www.popupcad.org), a purpose-built new CAD system for working with layered geometries.  PopupCAD has the following features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a sketching tool which allows you to draw basic shapes, specify dimensions and constraints, draw text, and import dxf geometry</li>
      <li>a design tree which allows you to create laminate shapes from sketches, existing imported laminate designs, etc, and then use and reuse them in a logical way to create all the geometries necessary to manufacture your device.</li>
      <li>a variety of basic operations which give popupCAD to apply constructive solid geometry operations, [morphological operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_morphology)</li>
    </ul>
