Hi all, I wanted to share a tool I use all the time, called "pandoc".  It allows me to convert formatted text in html, latex, markdown, word, etc into any other format.  There are a ton of options.  The default output may not add much flair, but it is a lifesaver when working in teams where the team can only work in some types of files but you have source material in others.  Think commonizing class material, proposal text, etc.

There are some high level things you can do to make it even more useful, such as creating templates (which are outside the scope of this post);  I made a standard word/latex template for course documents, nsf proposals, and signed letters and most of my work is done for me, and all I have to think about is writing.
