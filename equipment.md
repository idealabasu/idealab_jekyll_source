The IDEAlab at Arizona State Univerity's Polytechnic Schol has a wide variety of equipment available for the design, prototyping, simulation, analysis, and testing of low-cost robotic devices.  

Prototyping laminate robotic devices involves several planar processes which are available within the lab, including cutting, alignment, and lamination.  We are capable of cutting a variety of flat, rolled, or sheet materials on either a Vinyl Express R31 Vinyl Cutter or an Epilog Fusion M2 CO2/Fiber Laser Cutter with a 28" x 40" bed.  Lamination is made possible via a ProMount Plus 2700 27" Heated Roll Mounting Laminator, a 16" X 24" Giantex Digital Clamshell Heat Press, a wide-frame, floor mounted impulse sealer, and a small craft iron for detailed work.  Larger format materials can be cut out on a 4' x 8' ShopBot Router located in the Polytechnic Schools' Innovation Hub.

Prototyping three-dimensional parts is made possible with a Makergear M2 3D printer, and 3D milling or 2D routing operations can be performed on a 3-axis Shapeoko 3 CNC router.  For higher-resolution printing jobs the Innovation Hub has a multi-material Stratysis Objet Connex 350.  Additionally, the IDEAlab houses a fume hood and is in the process of acquiring a vacuum chamber and oven for casting and curing liquid polymers.

We have two mechatronics fabrication stations equipped with all the standard tools required to prototype and test circuit boards, sensors, and actuators.  Equipment includes multimeters, oscilloscopes, soldering stations, reflow station, etc.

We are currently in the process of expanding our characterization and experimentation hardware.  We are acquiring a Universal Robots UR5 Robotic arm with a 300N-rated Robotiq 6-axis force/torque for testing and evaluating robotic systems up to 5kg.  Additionally, for capturing spatial data we have two(soon to be six) OptiTrack 17W motion-tracking cameras capable of 320 FPS.  Force measurement is currently possible via two Mark-10 force gauges rated for 10 and 200 lbf, respectively.  This equipment will all be mounted on a Thorlabs vibration isolating table, which will feature a modular and reconfigurable aluminum frame for fast reconfiguration to enable testing the variety of robotic systems that are being prototyped.

The IDEAlab's simulation and analysis capabilities include an HTC Vive Virtual reality system, ABAQUS Multiphysics modeling capabilities, and a variety of desktop computing stations loaded with IDEAlab's many design and analysis tools.
