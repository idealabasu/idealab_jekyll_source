I will be applying the skills I have learned during the foldable robotics class in the estimation of kinematics, design and fabrication of the robotic leg using software such as Python and SolidWorks. To gauge the dynamics of the leg for different functions I will be using Unity Simulation Engine and Visual Studio to validate the results of experimental testing and biomechanics research.</description></item><item><title>Buoyancy Control of a Bio-inspired Robotic Fish</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/alia-gilbert/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/alia-gilbert/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Canal Maintenance and Cleaning via Autonomous Fish-Inspired Robots</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/srp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/srp/</guid><description>In this project, the goal is to build an AUV that explores the water canals and performs cleaning of these canals as necessary. We have selected the fin propulsion mechanism as the propulsion system for our AUV. Essentially, we are designing and building an underwater robot that will use a fin to move inside water. Our capability of using a laminated robot, will give us more advantage in easily gain the required stiffness in the tail in order to overcome the water drag.</description></item><item><title>Childrenâ€™s Engineering Kit</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/hebellyn-quezada/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/hebellyn-quezada/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Control of a biped laminate robot</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/taha-shafa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/taha-shafa/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Design of a Cutting Tool for Clearing Underwater Vegetation</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/sheena-benson/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/sheena-benson/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Design of a Hopping Platform using Laminate Construction</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/jacob-knaup-hopping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/jacob-knaup-hopping/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Design, Implementation, and Testing of a Force-Sensing Quadrupedal Laminate Robot</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/ben-shuch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/ben-shuch/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Development and Validation of a Custom Soft-Body FEA Simulator for Rapid Prototyping</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/erick-duarte/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/erick-duarte/</guid><description>Descriprion How reliable are the forces generated by a simulation of a soft hydrogel robot when compared to a real-life counterpart
Hydrogels are water-swollen three-dimensional polymeric networks that respond to specific stimuli, such as electrical signals, magnetic fields, mechanical stress, light, or temperature1. These stimuli cause a controllable change in the shape or volume of the hydrogel, physically altering the molecular interactions in the material. Voxels represent a value on a regular grid in three-dimensional space.</description></item><item><title>Development of an Multi-Process Planning Tool</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/cole-brauer-manufacturing-planning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/cole-brauer-manufacturing-planning/</guid><description>This project seeks to provide methods and set of tools for processing, modifying, and generating 3D models that use multiple materials and fabrication processes. Areas of research include planning of fabrication steps, automatic part modification, optimization of component properties, and generation of the files and fixtures needed to produce multi-material parts. Implementation of these algorithms is done in Python using a voxel-based model representation. This work will make multi-material fabrication more accessible for educational and research robotics.</description></item><item><title>Extending the Jumping Range of a Small Robot via Collapsible Gliding Wings</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/guston-lighthouse/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/guston-lighthouse/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Foldable Robotic Elephant Trunk</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/mannat-rana/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/mannat-rana/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Low-Cost, Modular Force Control Solution</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/jacob-knaup-force-sensing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/jacob-knaup-force-sensing/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Modular Tail for Stabilizing Robot Platforms</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/frank-onoye/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/frank-onoye/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Octopus-Inspired Soft Hydrogel Robots</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/roozbeh-khodambashi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/roozbeh-khodambashi/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Signals in the Soil</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/sits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/sits/</guid><description>Funding: This work was supported by NSF Award #1841574</description></item><item><title>Testing Method of Stiffening Actuators</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/anson-kwan-furi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/anson-kwan-furi/</guid><description>Objective &amp;amp; Research Question The goal of this project is to design a platform that can evaluate the performance of wearable robotic prototypes designed to stiffen on command for the purpose support and stabilization.

The wings are designed to provide stabilization for different gait such as running, hopping and jumping. The project aims to develop a reliable dynamics model which includes biped dynamics as well as aerodynamics for creating and testing multiple designs optimized for various gaits. The aerodynamic simulations are run on a vortex-lattice code \u201CVORLAX\u201D, which provides numeric simulation of the defined geometric bodies.</description></item></channel></rss>
