This project will focus on developing a testing platform built on the Robotic Operating System (ROS) for testing various foldable robots with a number of different integrated hardware solutions. The project will require familiarity with Python, Linux, serial and ethernet-based communication protocols.
The goal is that by the end of the summer, numerous systems will be communicating and controlled over a ROS-based network.</description></item><item><title>New Paper on Hydrogels</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/news/2021-01-25-new-paper-on-hydrogels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/news/2021-01-25-new-paper-on-hydrogels/</guid><description>Congrats to Roozbeh Khodambashi and the rest of our research team for our new paper in Advanced Materials.

Description Foldable Robotics is a class which comes from a new class of active robotic devices being developed in research labs across the country. These devices are designed and built using flat sheets of a wide variety of materials, and folded up to create both form and motion. This class studies these devices from initial prototype and design through implementation and optimization, with a focus on application-specific projects which seek to solve problems of cost, parallelism, complexity, and time with a relatively fast and easy prototyping method.</description></item><item><title>Keen Professorship</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/news/2017-05-16-keen-professorship/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/news/2017-05-16-keen-professorship/</guid><description>Dr. Aukes has been named a 2017 Keen Professor!
