## Overview

**Daily Schedule:**  The camp will run 9am-4pm, Monday thru Friday June 13-17, 2022 in [Peralta Hall, Room 103](https://goo.gl/maps/YHSdg44DBqWG91Eh9) on the ASU Polytechnic Campus.  We will hold a **student showcase** from **3-4pm on Friday, June 17**.  Please review the [parking](#parking) information below if you plan to stop by.

## Check-in / Check-Out

* Check-in is 9:00am to 9:15am M-F.  Doors open at 9am.
* Check-out is 3:45pm-4:00pm M-F.  Doors close at 4pm.

It is highly encouraged that you drop your student off each day rather than have them drive and pay for parking, as it is the most economical option (Parking information [below](#parking)).  Lot 30 is the closest and easiest dropoff location.  There are 2 _free_ 20-minute pickup/dropoff spots located [here](https://goo.gl/maps/8kuUE78uMdwYcMw57).

We ask that you bring an ID each day, as our check-in/check-out procedure requires that we release students to an approved individual.  We will be emailing a request for you to fill out a check-in/check-out preference form to indicate if you would prefer to have your child drive or if you would like to add other responsible adults who have your permission to check your student in and out.

**_Please remember to bring your ID._**  If your student is driving themself, _**they**_ should bring their driver's license.

## Food, Water, Snacks

It is highly encouraged that students bring their lunch as it is the most economical option, but food is available for purchase on campus.  There are _no easily accessible fridges_ nearby to the classroom, so please remember to bring an ice-pack to keep lunches fresh through the morning.

Students should bring their own snacks and a personal water bottle.
