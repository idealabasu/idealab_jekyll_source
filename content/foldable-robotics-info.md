## Overview

**Daily Schedule:**  The camp will run 9am-4pm, Monday thru Friday June 13-17, 2022.  We will hold a **student showcase** from **3-4pm on Friday, June 17**.  Please review the [parking](#parking) information below if you plan to stop by.

## Check-in / Check-Out

It is highly encouraged that you drop your student off each day rather than have them drive and pay for parking, as it is the most economical option (Parking information [below](#parking)).  Lot 30 is the closest and easiest dropoff location.  There are 2 _free_ 20-minute pickup/dropoff spots located [here](https://goo.gl/maps/8kuUE78uMdwYcMw57).

We ask that you bring an ID each day, as our check-in/check-out procedure requires that we release students to an approved individual.  We will be sending out a [check-in/check-out preference form](https://secure.na4.documents.adobe.com/public/esignWidget?wid=CBFCIBAA3AAABLblqZhBTdMqDJKyWL08TAOE3kqMM2tPyi8PM7hp6NUI8ndqLMROCPEqWtGI4IjFYXxQXy-I*) if you would prefer to have your child drive or if you would like to add other responsible adults who have your permission to check your student in and out.

## Food, Water, Snacks

It is highly encouraged that students bring their lunch as it is the most economical option, but food is available for purchase on campus.  There is **not** a fridge nearby to the classroom, so please remember to bring a ice-pack to keep lunches fresh through the morning

Students should bring their own snacks and water.
