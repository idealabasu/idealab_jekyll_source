description: The objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between
  deformation of a foldable antenna and effective wavelength. Understanding this
  association could allow for remote sensing of curvature in flexible robots. Alternatively,
  the correlation between deformation and effective wavelength could be leveraged
  to create tunable foldable antennas using closed-loop control techniques.
funding: This project was part of a Masters' thesis.
