The projects involve design of wings for a laminate biped robot for providing locomotion stabilization. The wings are designed to provide stabilization for different gait such as running, hopping and jumping. The project aims to develop a reliable dynamics model which includes biped dynamics as well as aerodynamics for creating and testing multiple designs optimized for various gaits. The aerodynamic simulations are run on a vortex-lattice code \u201CVORLAX\u201D, which provides  numeric simulation of the defined geometric bodies. The simulations are then to be plugged into the robot dynamics model, which is to be utilized for robot design iterations, simulations and design of a controller. "
