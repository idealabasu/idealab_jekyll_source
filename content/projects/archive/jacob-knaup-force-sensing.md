summary: Force control offers numerous benefits to robots over other control
  schemes such as more natural movements and increased sensitivity to the surrounding
  environment, but it is typically only available to high-end robots. This research
  aims to develop a modular force control solution for low-cost robots. The solution
  is designed to be easy to incorporate into future laminate robots, allowing the
  designer to add force control capabilities, while placing minimal constraints
  on the design.
funding: Funding for this project was provided by FURI.
