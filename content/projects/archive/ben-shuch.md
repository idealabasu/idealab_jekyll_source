description: In this project we present a low-cost force-sensing quadrupedal laminate
  robot platform. The robot has two degrees of freedom on each of four independent
  legs, allowing for a variety of motion trajectories to be created at each leg,
  thus creating a rich control space to explore on a relatively low-cost robot.
  This platform will allow a user to research complex motion and gait analysis control
  questions, and use different concepts in computer science and control theory methods
  to permit  it to walk.   The motion trajectory of each leg has been modeled in
  Python. Critical design considerations are the complexity of the laminate design,
  the rigidity of the materials of which the laminate is constructed, the accuracy
  of the transmission to control each leg, and the design of the force sensing legs.
