summary: Standard robotic arms are limited by their cost, size, and lack of
  flexibility. These factors make standard robotic arms difficult to apply in complex
  scenarios. While traditional, rigid  robotic arms are used in factories and plants,
  they require meticulous planning, spacious locations, heavy funding, and can only
  be used for limited purposes, as they are inherently unsafe around humans.  Laminate
  devices, on the other hand, are far more compact, flexible, cheap, and modular,
  as they use flat, somewhat flexible materials which fold up like a popup-book
  to create complex nonlinear motion. With these advantages in mind, I propose to
  research continuum robot arms made using foldable, laminate techniques, using
  an elephant trunk as a source of inspiration. The elephant trunk has more degrees
  of freedom than the standard robotic arm, which allows it to perform complex manipulation
  tasks in unstructured natural environments.  This concept, when applied to a robotic
  arm, would allow it to be used in many more applications, and could be designed
  to accomplish a variety of tasks ill-suited to typical robot arms. Furthermore,
  the system could be designed to be collapsible, which would make it modular, portable,
  and easily deployable, increasing its applications further.
