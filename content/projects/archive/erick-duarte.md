## Descriprion

_How reliable are the forces generated by a simulation of a soft hydrogel robot when compared to a real-life counterpart_

Hydrogels are water-swollen three-dimensional polymeric networks that respond to specific stimuli, such as electrical signals, magnetic fields, mechanical stress, light, or temperature1. These stimuli cause a controllable change in the shape or volume of the hydrogel, physically altering the molecular interactions
in the material.  Voxels represent a value on a regular grid in three-dimensional space. Similarly to a pixel with an added dimension, and just like pixels, voxels can be used to make shapes and structures.  Voxels allow the user to create discrete packages of material that perform predictably 
and are easy to use. Hydrogel can technically be cast into many shapes and sizes, but using uniform cubes simplifies changes in the design, especially when many
iterations are expected.
