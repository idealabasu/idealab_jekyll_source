summary: "I am expanding the work done by previous Master\u2019s Student Ben\
    \ Shuch in the field of Quadrupedal Robotic Locomotion. I am utilizing force sensing\
    \ to calculate the center of balance of a quadrupedal laminate robot with the\
    \ end goal of implementing a controls system capable of adapting in real time\
    \ to changing ground angles. Each of the robot\u2019s four legs have two degrees\
    \ of freedom and are controlled by a four-bar system powered by two servo motors.\
    \ While standing in place, the robot will behave like a parallel manipulator;\
    \ when standing on an angled table, it will use the difference between the current\
    \ force distribution and an ideal force distribution for balance to direct a change\
    \ in leg length to counteract the angled ground. The laminate materials used to\
    \ construct the robot make it a more cost effective research platform for researching\
    \ controls problems."
