summary: "Currently, a lot of focus previously for laminate robots has been\
    \ on design, but more complex applications require higher level design. The aim\
    \ of my project is to demonstrate that laminate robots can be utilized for higher\
    \ level design by designing a laminate biped with model-based controls that can\
    \ balance while standing and walking. This project starts from the early\nprototyping\
    \ design stage. Designs are created using python and Solidworks; PopupCAD is used\
    \ to produce the DXF files needed for high speed laminate manufacturing. Through\
    \ testing various design iterations, a design was reached with the ability to\
    \ stand. The motors of this design were then modified to meet desired torque parameters.\
    \ Testing has shown high torque is necessary to utilize robust control techniques,\
    \ which will be used to balance the biped while it both stands and walks. Through\
    \ python-based physics simulations utilizing Kane\u2019s method, a model of the\
    \ bipedal design can be created and linearized for controls applications. Since\
    \ the system is fully controllable, LQR control techniques will be applied for\
    \ balancing while standing and walking.  Eventually, different control systems\
    \ can be design and implemented for various system applications."
