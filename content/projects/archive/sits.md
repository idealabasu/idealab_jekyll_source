description: What's inside the ground leaves us a mystery, and we are trying to
    use the self-boring robot nodes to collect signals underground. Currently, we
    are focusing on the soft material-granular media contacting behavior, adding material
    compliance into granular media RFT model. With a sand-burrowing robot platform
    built, we are validating the model, adding sensors, and implementing control.
    As a final goal, a series of self-burrowing digging robots will be created, enabling
    us to sense underground environments with minimal human intervention.
