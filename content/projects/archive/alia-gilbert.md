description: This project focuses on controlling the altitude of an underwater robot
  meant to do environmental cleanup of vegetation in a canal. A bladder modeled
  off fish anatomy will be designed containing two bulbs, likely of laminate material,
  with a tube containing a pump. The pump will transfer air between the two bulbs
  to control the direction of the buoyancy in the robot. The shift in buoyancy will
  allow the body of the robot to move either up or down. Using this laminate material
  in prototyping for underwater robotics allows for low cost testing and quick turnaround
  time for iterations. We will be checking consistency of the level that the robot
  is driving using an IMU to control the amount of water or air in the bulbs of
  the systems.
