description: 'The objective of this research is to further the development of the
  bio-inspired fish being and constructed by Dr. Aukes and his team of student researchers
  by designing an inexpensive, reliable, and effective cutting tool to be used in
  conjunction with the robotic fish to cut and reduce the number of underwater vegetation
  growing in canals and waterways here in Phoenix. Such a device would reduce the
  cost and manpower currently used to clear those canals. Without clearing aquatic
  plants from the canals, certain parts of the city would also become vulnerable
  to increased flooding in the event of a sudden downpour, leading to possible infrastructure
  damage. '
funding: Funding for this project was provided by FURI.
