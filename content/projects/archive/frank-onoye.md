summary: "Based on the idea that robots can be made to display many features\
  \ of animals such as locomotion, the goal of this thesis is to recreate a tail\
  \ based on the mechanics of a cheetah since the use of its tail is the most effective\
  \ in dynamic stability and test its effectiveness on an inherently unstable object\
  \ such as an rc car. The question focuses on which tail design is necessary to\
  \ fix an inherently unstable object. This topic is derived from how a cheetah\
  \ uses its tail to stabilize itself while catching prey. The question of developing\_\
  \ a design will be answered by creating a unity model inspired by a cheetah\u2019\
  s tail and simulate how it will stabilize an object that lacks balance. The selected\
  \ platform is an rc car. The model is already developed in unity, but its movement\
  \ is not unstable. After making the inherently unstable by adjusting the scaling\
  \ of the object to make it taller, the motor speed, turning angle, mass of the\
  \ cube, mass of the wheels, and radius of the wheels, a motor and tail will be\
  \ added for balance. The selected rc car will be adjusted to match the parameters\
  \ in unity. The expected result of this procedure is to have a display of a real\
  \ life model matching the simulation.\_"
