description: "The purpose of this project is to create a kit that aims to spark\
  \ an interest in engineering for preadolescents and investigate what are effective\
  \ methods of doing so. The highlight of this project is the implementation of\
  \ Choice Theory, which proposes that student engagement increases when they are\
  \ presented with a series of options to choose from. The kit will consist of lessons\
  \ that diverge in different directions on multiple steps to represent the diversity\
  \ of engineering solutions. In the end, these branched out paths will merge together\
  \ to a single product to show students the interconnectedness of different engineering\
  \ disciplines. The students\u2019 interaction and completion of the kit will be\
  \ analyzed to determine what level of complexity and guidance is best suited for\
  \ preadolescents. \n"
funding: This project was funded as part of a Barrett Honors thesis.
