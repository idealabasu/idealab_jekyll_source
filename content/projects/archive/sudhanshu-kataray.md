title: Bio-inspired bipedal robot design
---

My research draws inspiration from terrestrial avians in terms of development of an optimized leg design for bipedal walking, running and jumping.  I will be applying the skills I have learned during the foldable robotics class in the estimation of kinematics, design and fabrication of the robotic leg using software such as Python and SolidWorks. To gauge the dynamics of the leg for different functions I will be using Unity Simulation Engine and Visual Studio to validate the results of experimental testing and biomechanics research.  My team has already created a model for the leg which we will begin to conduct experiments on. I have used Unity to help test motor parameters in order to select a motor with the best combination of gear ratios, masses and torques for our leg design.
