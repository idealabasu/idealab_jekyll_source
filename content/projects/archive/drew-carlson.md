summary: This project explores the design and development of a robotic gripper
  using low cost materials. It uses a four-bar mechanism to grasp objects. The system
  is back driven until the finger makes contact with an object. The servo continues
  to drive over coming the force of a spring holding the gripper in a open position
  providing the method of under-actuation.   The laminate design allows for multiple
  materials to be used. This can be exploited to make the contact points more flexible
  for the inclusion of flex sensors. By using multiple low cost flex sensors the
  location, number, and amount of force being applied in the grip can be determined
  using beam theory as a model.
