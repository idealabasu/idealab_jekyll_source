description: We are working to create a framework for design, rapid prototyping
    and control of robust, energy-efficient, autonomous soft arms with octopus-inspired
    distributed neuromuscular sensing and actuation. The arms will be capable of continuous
    deformation through the use of hydrogel "muscles" and distributed sensing through
    the use of embedded silver "neuron" interconnections. Such a unique octopus-inspired
    design forms a built-in local "sensing-actuation" feedback loop to achieve adaptive
    reconfiguration in response to the local environment. Such local adaptation will
    enable the robot to perform high-level tasks such as locomotion and reversible
    adhesion without coordination from a central controller in a highly accurate,
    rapid, and energy-efficient way. This study will also produce fundamental principles
    and theory for the modeling and control of soft robots in a way which leverages
    their unique capabilities and is inspired by how cephalopod appendages interact
    with their environment.
