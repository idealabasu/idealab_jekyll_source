Elementary students have had a harder time staying engaged in the material during class
time, especially since the start of Covid, whether they are online or in-person. Due to the virus,
schools require there be enough materials for each individual student to work with so that they
can all participate in the activity. Since the schools and teachers generally do not get enough
funding, the teachers have to resort to doing the activity themselves under the document camera.
Hands-on activities generally help keep the students involved in the curriculum and help them to
remember what they have learned. In order to make sure every student can have their own
materials, the project kits need to be low-cost and easily accessible.
The creative project will be to create a working prototype kit that can teach multiple
lessons of the curriculum that the schools or individual families could purchase. The curriculum
would be centered on the engineering and science curriculum that is introduced from fourth to
sixth grade classes. By creating an interactive kit that the students could individualize and use for
multiple lessons, the goal is to get them more engaged in the material.
