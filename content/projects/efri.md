## Pinched Tubes

Thin-walled cylindrical tubes can be pinched to create compliant, virtual joints in any radial direction, and then recover their original shape and stiffness once released. Through careful design and material selection, this can result in large changes in stiffness between the original shape, the intended degree of freedom, and orthogonal axes; resulting flexures can then used as passive, compliant rotational joints. Since the manufacturing of these tubes it is compatible with 3D printing processes, its shape can be easily adjusted and reprinted as more is learned about its performance.Thin-walled cylindrical tubes can be pinched to create compliant, virtual joints in any radial direction, and then recover their original shape and stiffness once released.

## Buckling Beams

A flat, slender, compliant beam shows little resistance towards bending; however, by inducing curvature in it, the resulting curved beam resists bending in the direction opposing its camber (known as opposite sense bending) more than when the beam is bent in the direction of the beam's camber (equal sense bending). The influence of curvature results in different buckling limits in equal and opposite sense bending as well.

The beam stiffness can be tuned through changing the beam length, camber angle, and width. By careful consideration during mechanical design, the preferential buckling of curved beams can be used to passively produce positive net work and moments even during symmetric inputs; this reduces the complexity of the control problem.
