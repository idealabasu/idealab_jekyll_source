## Foldable Robotics Camp

[Register Now](https://specialevents.asu.edu/672513)

* June 13-17, 2022
* $250/student
* ASU Polytechnic Campus

In this exciting hands-on, half-day camp for high schoolers, participants will be introduced to the principles of robot design through origami -- the art of paper folding -- to prototype, ideate, and get a hands-on sense of the physics of robots.

Participants will learn:

* how to use the biological world as a source of inspiration for designing robots, and how to translate those principles into a set of engineering design goals.
* how to ideate, prototype, and synthesize robotic devices through folded mechanisms, and how force, torque, and motion can be tuned through these structures to make robots move better.
* Coding a microcontroller to generate motion with an RC servo-motor.
* how to take real-world data from a foldable robot and use physical models to improve robot performance

This week-long, hands-on, project-based approach will emphasize problem identification, brainstorming, problem solving, rapid prototyping, teamwork, and communication. The camp will culminate with a final build -- that students can program to move through the environment -- along with an exposition for parents.
