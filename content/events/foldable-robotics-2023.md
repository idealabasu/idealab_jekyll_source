## About

* ASU Polytechnic Campus
* Registration Opening March 15, 2023
* Early Registration Ends May 15, 2023
* June 12-16, 2023, 9am-4pm each day.
* \$250 per student (\$275 after May 15)
* Open to Students 13-17

In this exciting hands-on, day camp, participants will be introduced to the principles of robot design through origami -- the art of paper folding -- to prototype, ideate, and get a hands-on sense of the physics of robots.

## Topics

Participants will learn:

* how to use the biological world as a source of inspiration for designing robots, and how to translate those principles into a set of engineering design goals.
* how to ideate, prototype, and synthesize robotic devices through folded mechanisms, and how force, torque, and motion can be tuned through these structures to make robots move better.
* Coding a microcontroller to generate motion with an RC servo-motor.
* how to take real-world data from a foldable robot and use physical models to improve robot performance

This week-long, hands-on, project-based approach will emphasize problem identification, brainstorming, problem solving, rapid prototyping, teamwork, and communication. The camp will culminate with a final build -- that students can program to move through the environment -- along with a Friday afternoon exposition for parents.

Students will be able to take their development kits home with them at the end of the week.  Example parts & materials include:

* Programmable microcontroller
* Breadboard & wire
* RC Servo(s)
* Sensor(s)
* Craft essentials: scissors, stapler, tape, rubber bands
