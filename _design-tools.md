Design Tools
============

We are developing a suite of design tools intended to work together to give a picture of how a designed robot will perform, as well as interact with the world.

We have developed [popupCAD](http://www.popupcad.org), a purpose-built new CAD system for working with layered geometries.  PopupCAD has the following features:

* a sketching tool which allows you to draw basic shapes, specify dimensions and constraints, draw text, and import dxf geometry
* a design tree which allows you to create laminate shapes from sketches, existing imported laminate designs, etc, and then use and reuse them in a logical way to create all the geometries necessary to manufacture your device.
* a variety of basic operations which give popupCAD to apply constructive solid geometry operations, [morphological operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_morphology)

<h2>Soft Design Tool</h2>

This tool has been developed to make it possible to understand the deformation of soft structures during the design process.

<h2>Laminate Scripting Language</h2>

This scripting package has been developed to make coding laminate structures possible without a GUI.  With similar computational capabilties to  popupCAD, this scripting tool permits one to use the Python programming language directly to more efficiently represent the mathematical operations of laminate design.
