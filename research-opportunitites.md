The IDEAlab at ASU is always looking for researchers in the field of robotics, design, and manufacturing.  Get involved by coming to lab meetings and assisting on one of our existing projects.


## PhD Research

<!--

The IDEAlab at ASU is hiring PhD students in the field of robotics, design, and manufacturing. We are looking for students interested in the following topics:

Developing new ways to make low-cost robots using non-traditional materials and methods.

Building new design tools(CAD/CAM) for emerging manufacturing methods and rapid prototyping, with a focus on STEM education. Integrating analysis methods more closely with design and manufacturing; for example, adding dynamics, kinematics, simulation, and FEA alongside design software tailored to specific material systems. Solving tough robotic challenges by applying the lab’s strengths in design, analysis, and manufacturing. Interested applicants should hold a Masters(MS) in Mechanical Engineering or a similar topic. Applicants must demonstrate a strong theoretical and
applied background in design, kinematics, dynamics, mechatronics, robotics, and manufacturing. Applicants should be proficient programmers(Python, C, C++), debuggers(electronics and code), and makers(rapid prototyping and machining).

If you are interested in these topics, please attach a CV and one-page summary of your research interests to [hidden email].

(Due to the large number of requests, I may not be able to respond individually to each email, but I will review each one carefully.)

------------------------

The IDEAlab is part of the Polytechnic School of Engineering, the newest school of engineering at Arizona State University. The Polytechnic Campus in Mesa, AZ is located in a fast-growing part of the Phoenix metropolitan area, with easy access to downtown areas Phoenix and Tempe, while being extraordinarily close to outdoor activities such as hiking and biking. It also features a 15,000 sqf maker space called the Startup Lab and new facilities centered around robotics and manufacturing.

ASU is #1 in the U.S. for innovation U.S. News & World Report ranked ASU No. 1 among the “Most Innovative Schools” in America for 2016, ahead of Stanford at No. 2, MIT at No. 3, as well as Duke, Harvard and Cornell. The top rating was conferred by leading college officials across the country based on ASU’s curriculum, faculty, students, campus life, technology and facilities.

## Masters Research

**We do not generally fund masters research.**

### Masters Thesis

If your research goals are well aligned with existing, ongoing work in the IDEAlab, Dr. Aukes is willing to serve on your masters thesis committee, *provided the student is willing to commit to submitting their work to a journal at the end of their project.*

### Masters Project

Due to time limitations, Dr. Aukes is not able to advise Masters Projects at this time.  Please consider a Masters Thesis, as the opportunities for producing high-quality, publishable work is enhanced via the thesis route.


### MORE

The MORE Initiative is a unique opportunity to get involved in research during your masters experience.  In general, planning for your application involves identifying a research topic of interest, speaking with Dr. Aukes to ensure it fits within the scope of the IDEAlab, and coming up with the deliverables required by the FURI program.  *Please see Dr. Aukes at the beginning of the semester in order to plan your MORE application.*


## Undergraduate Research

### Barrett Honors Thesis

Dr. Aukes has availability to serve on Barrett Thesis committees, *provided the student is willing to commit to submitting their work to a conference or journal at the end of their project.*

For more information, see <https://barretthonors.asu.edu/academics/thesis-and-creative-project/>

### FURI

The Fulton Undergraduate Research Initiative is a unique opportunity to get involved in research during your undergraduate experience.  In general, planning for your application involves identifying a research topic of interest, speaking with Dr. Aukes to ensure it fits within the scope of the IDEAlab, and coming up with the deliverables required by the FURI program.  *Please see Dr. Aukes at the beginning of the semester in order to plan your FURI application.*
