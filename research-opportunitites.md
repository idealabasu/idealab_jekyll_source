## Graduate

The IDEAlab at ASU is always looking for researchers in the field of robotics, design, and manufacturing.  Get involved by coming to lab meetings and assisting on one of our existing projects.

We do not generally fund masters research.

## FURI

The Fulton Undergraduate Research Initiative is a unique opportunity to get involved in research during your undergraduate experience.  In general, planning for your application involves identifying a research topic of interest, speaking with Dr. Aukes to ensure it fits within the scope of the IDEAlab, and coming up with the deliverables required by the FURI program.

 Please see Dr. Aukes at the beginning of the semester in order to plan your FURI application.
