The IDEAlab at ASU is always looking for researchers in the field of robotics, design, and manufacturing.  Get involved by coming to lab meetings and assisting on one of our existing projects.


## PhD Research

Please contact Dr. Aukes directly or look on the "jobs" link for current opportunities.  Unless there is a current posting, there is a low chance of unsolicited emails getting a response

## Masters Research

**We do not *generally* fund masters research.**

### Masters Thesis

If your research goals are well aligned with existing, ongoing work in the IDEAlab, Dr. Aukes is willing to serve on your masters thesis committee, *provided the student is willing to commit to submitting their work to a journal at the end of their project.*

### Masters Project

Due to time limitations, Dr. Aukes is not able to advise Masters Projects at this time.  Please consider a Masters Thesis, as the opportunities for producing high-quality, publishable work is enhanced via the thesis route.


### MORE

The MORE Initiative is a unique opportunity to get involved in research during your masters experience.  In general, planning for your application involves identifying a research topic of interest, speaking with Dr. Aukes to ensure it fits within the scope of the IDEAlab, and coming up with the deliverables required by the FURI program.  *Please see Dr. Aukes at the beginning of the semester in order to plan your MORE application.*
