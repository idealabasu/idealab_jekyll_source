PhD Position
============

The [IDEAlab](http://idealab.asu.edu) at ASU is hiring PhD students in the field of robotics, design, and manufacturing.  We are looking for students interested in the following topics:

* Developing new ways to make low-cost robots using non-traditional materials and methods.
* Building new design tools(CAD/CAM) for emerging manufacturing methods and rapid prototyping, with a focus on STEM education.
* Integrating analysis methods more closely with design and manufacturing; for example, adding dynamics, kinematics, simulation, and FEA alongside design software tailored to specific material systems.
* Solving tough robotic challenges by applying the lab's strengths in design, analysis, and manufacturing.

Interested applicants should hold a Masters(MS) in Mechanical Engineering or a similar topic.  Applicants must demonstrate a strong theoretical and applied background in design, analysis, mechatronics, robotics, and manufacturing.  Applicants should be proficient programmers(Python, C, C++), debuggers(electronics and code), and makers(rapid prototyping and machining).  

If you are interested in these topics, please attach a CV and one-page summary of your research interests to [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}).  We will also be at ICRA2016 to speak with prospective students and to discuss our work in more detail.

The IDEAlab is part of the Polytechnic School of Engineering, the newest school of engineering at Arizona State University.  The Polytechnic Campus in Mesa, AZ is located in a fast-growing part of the Phoenix metropolitan area, with easy access to downtown areas Phoenix and Tempe, while being extraordinarily close to outdoor activities such as hiking and biking.  It also features a 15,000 sqf maker space called the Startup Lab and new facilities centered around robotics and manufacturing.

[ASU is #1 in the U.S. for innovation](https://asunow.asu.edu/content/asu-tops-us-news-world-report-list-most-innovative-schools)

U.S. News & World Report ranked ASU No. 1 among the “Most Innovative Schools” in America for 2016, ahead of Stanford at No. 2, MIT at No. 3, as well as Duke, Harvard and Cornell. The top rating was conferred by leading college officials across the country based on ASU’s curriculum, faculty, students, campus life, technology and facilities.
