PhD Position
============

The IDEAlab at ASU is hiring PhD students in the field of robotics, design, and manufacturing.  We are looking for students interested in the following topics:

* Developing new ways to make low-cost robots using non-traditional materials and methods.
* Solving tough robotic challenges by applying the lab's strengths in design, analysis, and manufacturing.
* Building new design tools(CAD/CAM) for emerging manufacturing methods and rapid prototyping, with a focus on STEM education.
* Integrating analysis methods more closely with design and manufacturing; for example, adding dynamics, kinematics, simulation, and FEA alongside design software tailored to specific material systems.

If you are interested in these topics, please [get in touch]({{site.baseurl}}/contact.html) about applying to ASU.  We will be at ICRA2016 to speak with prospective students and to discuss our work in more detail.
