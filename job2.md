## Multiple Positions for a Wearable Robotic Device

ASU is looking for multiple PhD students or Postdocs in the field(s) of robotics, biomechanics, machine learning, and human-machine interaction to join a new project on wearable hybrid robotic suits sponsored by the Kaiteki Institute[^Kaiteki Website: <http://idealab.asu.edu/kaiteki>]. We are looking for students interested in one or more the following topics:

-   Topic 1
    -   Biomechanics, human motion analysis, gait posture, stability
    -   Human machine interaction -- assistive robotics, wearable robotics, exoskeletons
-   Topic 2
    -   Design, prototyping and integration of robotic, wearable, assistive devices
    -   Integration of analysis techniques (kinematics, dynamics, simulation, and FEA into design workflows)
-   Topic 3
    -   Machine Learning for predictive control, motor skill learning, interaction learning, deep learning, probabilistic modelling of human motion, motion recognition, motion segmentation
    -   Dynamic modeling and control of soft robots, reinforcement learning for force and motion control of flexible robots.

Interested applicants should hold a Masters (MS) in Engineering, Computer Science or a related field. Applicants must demonstrate a strong theoretical and applied background in at least one of the following topics:

-   Robotics
-   Kinematics & Dynamics
-   Biomechanics
-   Machine Learning, Statistics
-   Controls

In terms of required skillsets, Applicants must have a strong background in gait analysis (thrust 1), design, rapid prototyping, and mechatronics (thrust 2), coding (MATLAB, Python) (thrust 2 & 3) and experimental data collection(all thrusts).

Ph.D. students will be embedded in a vibrant new research project sponsored by the Kaiteki Institute and led by Dr. Dan Aukes, Dr. Heni Ben Amor, Dr. Wenlong Zhang, Dr. Thomas Sugar and Dr. Hyunglae Lee. The research center has strong collaborations with leading robotics and machine learning research groups in the US, Europe and Japan.
