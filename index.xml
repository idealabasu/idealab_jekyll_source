This project will focus on developing a testing platform built on the Robotic Operating System (ROS) for testing various foldable robots with a number of different integrated hardware solutions. The project will require familiarity with Python, Linux, serial and ethernet-based communication protocols.
The goal is that by the end of the summer, numerous systems will be communicating and controlled over a ROS-based network.</description></item><item><title>New Paper on Hydrogels</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/news/2021-01-25-new-paper-on-hydrogels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/news/2021-01-25-new-paper-on-hydrogels/</guid><description>Congrats to Roozbeh Khodambashi and the rest of our research team for our new paper in Advanced Materials.

Description Foldable Robotics is a class which comes from a new class of active robotic devices being developed in research labs across the country. These devices are designed and built using flat sheets of a wide variety of materials, and folded up to create both form and motion. This class studies these devices from initial prototype and design through implementation and optimization, with a focus on application-specific projects which seek to solve problems of cost, parallelism, complexity, and time with a relatively fast and easy prototyping method.</description></item><item><title>Keen Professorship</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/news/2017-05-16-keen-professorship/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/news/2017-05-16-keen-professorship/</guid><description>Dr. Aukes has been named a 2017 Keen Professor!

Daniel M. Aukes is an Assistant Professor at Arizona State University, and is the Principal Investigator of the IDEAlab. His research investigates the nexus of design, manufacturing, and data-driven decision-making towards the development of robots that can operate in niche environments, with a focus on affordability and accessibility. He is a former Technology Development Fellow at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University and completed post-doctoral research in the Harvard MicroRobotics Lab with Rob Wood, developing manufacturing planning software for origami-inspired robots.</description></item><item><title>Equipment and Facilities</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/equipment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/equipment/</guid><description>The IDEAlab at Arizona State University&amp;rsquo;s Polytechnic School has a wide variety of equipment available for designing, prototyping, modeling, analyzing, simulating, and testing a variety of robotic devices made using less-traditional materials.
Prototyping laminate robotic devices involves several planar processes which are available within the lab, including cutting, alignment, and lamination. We are capable of cutting a variety of flat, rolled, or sheet materials on either a Vinyl Express R31 Vinyl Cutter or an Epilog Fusion M2 CO2/Fiber Laser Cutter with a 28&amp;quot; x 40&amp;quot; bed.</description></item><item><title>Hiring</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/hiring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/hiring/</guid><description>We are currently not hiring at this time.</description></item><item><title>Kaiteki Project</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/kaiteki/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/kaiteki/</guid><description>Motivation Potential sites around the human body
