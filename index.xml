This project will focus on developing a testing platform built on the Robotic Operating System (ROS) for testing various foldable robots with a number of different integrated hardware solutions. The project will require familiarity with Python, Linux, serial and ethernet-based communication protocols.
The goal is that by the end of the summer, numerous systems will be communicating and controlled over a ROS-based network.</description></item><item><title>New Paper on Hydrogels</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/news/2021-01-25-new-paper-on-hydrogels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/news/2021-01-25-new-paper-on-hydrogels/</guid><description>Congrats to Roozbeh Khodambashi and the rest of our research team for our new paper in Advanced Materials.

Description Foldable Robotics is a class which comes from a new class of active robotic devices being developed in research labs across the country. These devices are designed and built using flat sheets of a wide variety of materials, and folded up to create both form and motion. This class studies these devices from initial prototype and design through implementation and optimization, with a focus on application-specific projects which seek to solve problems of cost, parallelism, complexity, and time with a relatively fast and easy prototyping method.</description></item><item><title>Keen Professorship</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/news/2017-05-16-keen-professorship/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/news/2017-05-16-keen-professorship/</guid><description>Dr. Aukes has been named a 2017 Keen Professor!

Daniel M. Aukes is an Assistant Professor at Arizona State University, and is the Principal Investigator of the IDEAlab. His research investigates the nexus of design, manufacturing, and data-driven decision-making towards the development of robots that can operate in niche environments, with a focus on affordability and accessibility. He is a former Technology Development Fellow at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University and completed post-doctoral research in the Harvard MicroRobotics Lab with Rob Wood, developing manufacturing planning software for origami-inspired robots.</description></item><item><title>Design of a Cutting Tool for Clearing Underwater Vegetation</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/sheena-benson/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/sheena-benson/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Design of a Hopping Platform using Laminate Construction</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/jacob-knaup-hopping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/jacob-knaup-hopping/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Design, Implementation, and Testing of a Force-Sensing Quadrupedal Laminate Robot</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/ben-shuch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/ben-shuch/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Development and Validation of a Custom Soft-Body FEA Simulator for Rapid Prototyping</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/erick-duarte/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/erick-duarte/</guid><description>Descriprion How reliable are the forces generated by a simulation of a soft hydrogel robot when compared to a real-life counterpart
Hydrogels are water-swollen three-dimensional polymeric networks that respond to specific stimuli, such as electrical signals, magnetic fields, mechanical stress, light, or temperature1. These stimuli cause a controllable change in the shape or volume of the hydrogel, physically altering the molecular interactions in the material. Voxels represent a value on a regular grid in three-dimensional space.</description></item><item><title>Development of an Multi-Process Planning Tool</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/cole-brauer-manufacturing-planning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/cole-brauer-manufacturing-planning/</guid><description>This project seeks to provide methods and set of tools for processing, modifying, and generating 3D models that use multiple materials and fabrication processes. Areas of research include planning of fabrication steps, automatic part modification, optimization of component properties, and generation of the files and fixtures needed to produce multi-material parts. Implementation of these algorithms is done in Python using a voxel-based model representation. This work will make multi-material fabrication more accessible for educational and research robotics.</description></item><item><title>Equipment and Facilities</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/equipment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/equipment/</guid><description>The IDEAlab at Arizona State University&amp;rsquo;s Polytechnic School has a wide variety of equipment available for designing, prototyping, modeling, analyzing, simulating, and testing a variety of robotic devices made using less-traditional materials.

Millions of elderly around the world will be diagnosed with a mobility impairment due to stroke, Parkinson’s disease, or a weak musculoskeletal system. There are over 50 million people in the US living with physical disabilities compromising mobility. We take many daily activities for granted &amp;ndash; walking with a spouse or friend, playing with children, shopping in a store, using a bathroom on time and independently &amp;ndash; until we have reduced mobility.</description></item><item><title>Low-Cost Hands-On Engineering Projects and Curriculum for Elementary School Level Children</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/jade-heun/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/jade-heun/</guid><description>Elementary students have had a harder time staying engaged in the material during class time, especially since the start of Covid, whether they are online or in-person.

Background: Millions of elderly adults around the world experience loss of stability which can lead to falls and injury A wearable hybrid robotic system has been proposed to assist and support elderly users via a variety of potential prototyped solutions Being able to model the dynamic performance is essential to understanding these protypes The purpose of this test platform is to provide a generic interface to understand more about these designs Methods: Based off data collected from motion capture Torque = 80.</description></item><item><title>The Efficiency of Spine Stiffness in regards to Anguilliform Locomotion</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/anson-kwan-thesis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/anson-kwan-thesis/</guid><description>Fish come in varying shapes, sizes, and ecosystems that lead to a multitude of different modes of swimming. To categorizes these different methods, fish are separated by fin and body motion. In particular the order of fish Anguilliformes or ‘eel-like’ locomotion utilizes a large portion of their body to produce thrust while swimming known as undulatory locomotion [1]. Due to the developments of high-speed video capture, research with in the past two decades have been able to understand eel locomotion, kinematics, and hydrodynamics.</description></item><item><title>Underactuated Laminate gripper with Low-Cost Sensing.</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/drew-carlson/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/archive/drew-carlson/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Wearable Hybrid Robotic Suit for Self-Actualization and Well-Being</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/kaiteki/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/projects/kaiteki/</guid><description>Current Students Dongting Li

The wings are designed to provide stabilization for different gait such as running, hopping and jumping. The project aims to develop a reliable dynamics model which includes biped dynamics as well as aerodynamics for creating and testing multiple designs optimized for various gaits. The aerodynamic simulations are run on a vortex-lattice code \u201CVORLAX\u201D, which provides numeric simulation of the defined geometric bodies.</description></item></channel></rss>
