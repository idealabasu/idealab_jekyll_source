      Daniel M. Aukes, Ph.D.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Daniel M. Aukes is an assistant professor in engineering at the Polytechnic School, starting in January.  He was a Wyss Institute Postdoctoral Fellow in Technology Development at Harvard University from 2013-2015, focusing on the design and manufacturing of laminate robots in conjunction with Rob Wood and the Harvard Microrobotics Laboratory.  He received his Ph.D. and M.S. in mechanical engineering from Stanford University in 2013 and 2009, studying the design of underactuated robotic hands under Mark Cutkosky.  He worked from 2004 to 2007 as a system integration engineer across a variety of industries, focusing on manufacturing and food processing automation.  He received his B.S. in mechanical engineering from Northwestern University in 2004.

    <p>
      I am a Mechanical engineer by education and an Electrical engineer by practice. Before I join the Systems engineering Ph.D. program at ASU, I was a masters student at Georgia Tech working in the area of prosthetics and human augmentation for musical applications under Prof. Weinberg. I received an M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology focusing the area of tactile sensing in robotics and minimally invasive surgery under Prof. Najarian. My B.Sc. is in Mechanical engineering from Shahrekord University.
